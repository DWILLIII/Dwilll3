    <div id="Hobbies">
        <h1 class="Main">Hobbies</h1>
        <p id="Enjoyment">My hobbies are mainly my daily routines that I go through every week day or week end. I like to listen to Hip Hop and R&B music, play sports (wrestling, football, baseball, track), spend time with my family, watch comedy, action, and horror movies with friends, and cook dinner with or for my family. I am also spontaneous and open to anything new introduced to me, so if others show me their hobbies I may join them and get a feeling for that hobby as well.</p>
